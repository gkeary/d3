# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application


This is the first application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) 
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

This example shows 2 things:
   first there are some simple MARKDOWN syntax examples
   2nd,  it shows that you should keep README.markdown up-to-date
     with some pithy comments about where the app is right now...
